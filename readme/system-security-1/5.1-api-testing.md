# 5.1 API Testing

{% embed url="https://portswigger.net/web-security/api-testing" %}

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) enable software systems and applications to communicate and share data. API testing is important as vulnerabilities in APIs may undermine core aspects of a website's confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

All dynamic websites are composed of APIs, so classic web vulnerabilities like SQL injection could be classed as API testing. In this topic, we'll teach you how to test APIs that aren't fully used by the website front-end, with a focus on RESTful and JSON APIs. We'll also teach you how to test for server-side parameter pollution vulnerabilities that may impact internal APIs.

You can also use a list of common paths to find documentation using Intruder.

#### Using machine-readable documentation <a href="#identifying-api-endpoints" id="identifying-api-endpoints"></a>

You can use a range of automated tools to analyze any machine-readable API documentation that you find.

You can use Burp Scanner to crawl and audit OpenAPI documentation, or any other documentation in JSON or YAML format. You can also parse OpenAPI documentation using the OpenAPI Parser BApp.

You may also be able to use a specialized tool to test the documented endpoints, such as Postman or SoapUI.

### Identifying API endpoints

You can also gather a lot of information by browsing applications that use the API. This is often worth doing even if you have access to API documentation, as sometimes documentation may be inaccurate or out of date.

You can use Burp Scanner to crawl the application, then manually investigate interesting attack surface using Burp's browser.

While browsing the application, look for patterns that suggest API endpoints in the URL structure, such as `/api/`. Also look out for JavaScript files. These can contain references to API endpoints that you haven't triggered directly via the web browser. Burp Scanner automatically extracts some endpoints during crawls, but for a more heavyweight extraction, use the [JS Link Finder](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/0e61c786db0c4ac787a08c4516d52ccf) BApp. You can also manually review JavaScript files in Burp.

### Identifying supported HTTP methods

The HTTP method specifies the action to be performed on a resource. For example:

* `GET` - Retrieves data from a resource.
* `PATCH` - Applies partial changes to a resource.
* `OPTIONS` - Retrieves information on the types of request methods that can be used on a resource.

An API endpoint may support different HTTP methods. It's therefore important to test all potential methods when you're investigating API endpoints. This may enable you to identify additional endpoint functionality, opening up more attack surface.

For example, the endpoint `/api/tasks` may support the following methods:

* `GET /api/tasks` - Retrieves a list of tasks.
* `POST /api/tasks` - Creates a new task.
* `DELETE /api/tasks/1` - Deletes a task.

### Identifying supported content types

API endpoints often expect data in a specific format. They may therefore behave differently depending on the content type of the data provided in a request. Changing the content type may enable you to:

* Trigger errors that disclose useful information.
* Bypass flawed defenses.
* Take advantage of differences in processing logic. For example, an API may be secure when handling JSON data but susceptible to injection attacks when dealing with XML.

### Using Intruder to find hidden endpoints

Once you have identified some initial API endpoints, you can use Intruder to uncover hidden endpoints. For example, consider a scenario where you have identified the following API endpoint for updating user information:

`PUT /api/user/update`

To identify hidden endpoints, you could use Burp Intruder to find other resources with the same structure. For example, you could add a payload to the `/update` position of the path with a list of other common functions, such as `delete` and `add`.

## Finding hidden parameters <a href="#finding-hidden-parameters" id="finding-hidden-parameters"></a>

When you're doing API recon, you may find undocumented parameters that the API supports. You can attempt to use these to change the application's behavior. Burp includes numerous tools that can help you identify hidden parameters:

* Burp Intruder
* The Param miner BApp
* The Content discovery tool

### Identifying hidden parameters

Since mass assignment creates parameters from object fields, you can often identify these hidden parameters by manually examining objects returned by the API.

For example, consider a `PATCH /api/users/` request, which enables users to update their username and email, and includes the following JSON:

`{ "username": "wiener", "email": "wiener@example.com", }`

A concurrent `GET /api/users/123` request returns the following JSON:

`{ "id": 123, "name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com", "isAdmin": "false" }`

This may indicate that the hidden `id` and `isAdmin` parameters are bound to the internal user object, alongside the updated username and email parameters.\
To test whether you can modify the enumerated `isAdmin` parameter value, add it to the `PATCH` request:

`{ "username": "wiener", "email": "wiener@example.com", "isAdmin": false, }`

In addition, send a `PATCH` request with an invalid `isAdmin` parameter value:

`{ "username": "wiener", "email": "wiener@example.com", "isAdmin": "foo", }`

If the application behaves differently, this may suggest that the invalid value impacts the query logic, but the valid value doesn't. This may indicate that the parameter can be successfully updated by the user.

You can then send a `PATCH` request with the `isAdmin` parameter value set to `true`, to try and exploit the vulnerability:

`{ "username": "wiener", "email": "wiener@example.com", "isAdmin": true, }`

If the `isAdmin` value in the request is bound to the user object without adequate validation and sanitization, the user `wiener` may be incorrectly granted admin privileges. To determine whether this is the case, browse the application as `wiener` to see whether you can access admin functionality.

### Preventing vulnerabilities in APIs <a href="#preventing-vulnerabilities-in-apis" id="preventing-vulnerabilities-in-apis"></a>

When designing APIs, make sure that security is a consideration from the beginning. In particular, make sure that you:

* Secure your documentation if you don't intend your API to be publicly accessible.
* Ensure your documentation is kept up to date so that legitimate testers have full visibility of the API's attack surface.
* Apply an allowlist of permitted HTTP methods.
* Validate that the content type is expected for each request or response.
* Use generic error messages to avoid giving away information that may be useful for an attacker.
* Use protective measures on all versions of your API, not just the current production version.

To prevent mass assignment vulnerabilities, allowlist the properties that can be updated by the user, and blocklist sensitive properties that shouldn't be updated by the user.\
